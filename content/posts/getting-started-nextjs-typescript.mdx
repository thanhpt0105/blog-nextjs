# Getting Started with Next.js 14 and TypeScript

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. In this post, we'll explore how to get started with the latest version using TypeScript.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for several reasons:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improved SEO and faster initial page loads
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time
- **App Router**: New routing system with improved performance
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript integration
- **API Routes**: Build your backend alongside your frontend

## Setting Up Your Project

First, create a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript configured out of the box.

## App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js 14 introduces the App Router as the recommended way to build applications. Here are the key differences:

### App Router Benefits

1. **Server Components**: React Server Components by default
2. **Layouts**: Nested layouts with shared UI
3. **Loading & Error States**: Built-in loading and error handling
4. **Streaming**: Progressive rendering for better UX

### File Structure

```
app/
  layout.tsx      # Root layout
  page.tsx        # Home page
  about/
    page.tsx      # About page
  blog/
    [slug]/
      page.tsx    # Dynamic blog post page
```

## TypeScript Best Practices

When working with Next.js and TypeScript, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Proper Types**: Define interfaces for your data structures
2. **Leverage Type Inference**: Let TypeScript infer types when possible
3. **Strict Mode**: Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
4. **Type Your Components**: Always type component props

```typescript
interface BlogPostProps {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  publishedAt: Date;
}

export default function BlogPost({ title, content, publishedAt }: BlogPostProps) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <time>{publishedAt.toLocaleDateString()}</time>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 with TypeScript provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. The combination of performance, developer experience, and type safety makes it an excellent choice for projects of all sizes.
